Global Tech ETF Analysis

This repository contains an ongoing project focused on analyzing long-term trends in several major global technology ETFs. The goal of this project is to get a clearer understanding of how different technology-focused funds have performed over time, and to gradually build a few simple tools for comparison and basic backtesting.

The initial version looks at three widely followed ETFs:

QQQ VGT SOXX

These ETFs represent different segments of the technology sector, from broad tech exposure to more concentrated semiconductor holdings.

Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is straightforward: to visualize and compare the long-term price movements of different tech ETFs in a clean and simple way. Instead of building anything complex at the beginning, this project starts with the basics—downloading the data, cleaning it, and plotting trends—before expanding into more detailed analysis later on.

Current Progress

The current notebook includes:

Downloading historical price data using yfinance

Preparing the data for analysis

Plotting long-term price trends for QQQ, VGT, and SOXX

This provides a simple first look at how these ETFs have moved over the past decade.

Planned Additions

Over time, this project will gradually include:

Basic buy-and-hold simulations

Monthly investment (DCA) modeling

Performance metrics such as CAGR, volatility, and maximum drawdown

Comparisons with additional ETFs

A simple dashboard (if needed later)

The plan is to keep the project lightweight and expand step by step.

Tools Used

Python, Google Colab, pandas, yfinance, matplotlib and Notebook

Main notebook:
Global_Tech_ETF_Analysis.ipynb

Notes

This project is still in progress and will be updated as more analysis is added. The aim is to keep it readable, simple, and practical.
